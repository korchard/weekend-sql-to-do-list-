# PROJECT NAME

WEEKEND SQL TO DO LIST

## Description

_Duration: 10 hours

This is a 'TO DO' application that allows the user to create a task, which is added and stored in a database. There are options to check the task as completed, to uncheck it, and delete it from the list.

### Prerequisites

Software that is required to install.

- [Node.js] - install in terminal
- [express] - install in terminal
- [pg] - install in terminal
- [moment] - install in terminal

## Installation

1. Create a database named `weekend-to-do-app`,
2. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install` - this will install `express`, `node.js`, `jQuery`, `moment` and `pg`.
4. Input in the package.json `"start": "node server/server.js"` - under scripts.
5. Run `npm start` in your terminal.
6. Open localhost:5000 in your browswer to use the application.

## Usage

1. Input your todo tasks into the input box - they will display on the DOM.
2. When a task is completed, check the marked box on the far left. - There will be a display change to recognize the task has been checked - and the date and time that you have completed the task will display.
3. If you accidentally check a task as completed, but have not completed it, click the check marked box again and it will return to an incomplete status.
4. When you want to remove a task from the list, there is a delete button on the fart right to press and a safety catch if you accidentally press it to ensure you mean to remove it.
